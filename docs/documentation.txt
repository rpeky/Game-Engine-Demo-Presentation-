T-637-GEDE Game Engine Demo Presentation
Group 11 - Ryan Pek Yi Ze

Godot 4 (4.6) was picked because:
(1) It had the word Ogre next to it in the engine list and 
(2) I've seen it before in my home university but have never touched it, so this would be a good chance to try it out

I went through the godot documentation, some videos on youtube and some site called gdquest. I have listed the accessed documents below

    Skimmed through the video tutorials (they are pretty long)

Initial observations
Godot is an engine that offers features for game development in both 2D and 3D.
It may be a little greedy, but I want to try making a prototype that swaps between 2D and 3D rendering via some kind of mechanism.
Objectives I have set are
    to make something simple, 
    able to move and view the environment,
    interact with the environment/other nodes,
    some kind of mechanism or keybind to swap between 2d/3d


Stuff Done
    Input mapping (basic wasd/updownleftright/space/e/p)
